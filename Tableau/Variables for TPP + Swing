### Tableau doesn't actually allow creating scripts like this easily but it is a pain to look for individual variables
### as such this is a collection of variables used for creating my Goldstein TPP and Swing maps

## Vote totals

# Absentee / Postal votes
SUM(IIF([PollingPlaceID]=0,[votes from SA1],0))

# In person votes
SUM(IIF([PollingPlaceID]!=0,[votes from SA1],0))


## ALP TPP Calculation variables

# Approx TPP calculation for votes from an SA1 based on average of booths used and amount that visited
# Intermediate step non postal / absentee * Labor TPP
SUM(IIF([PollingPlaceID]!=0,([votes from SA1]*[Australian Labor Party Percentage]/100),0))

# TPP non postal
[Intermediate step non postal / absentee * Labor TPP]/[Votes non postal / absentee from SA1]

# TPP for postals based on difference between % for Absentee / Postals combined 
# TPP postal 
[TPP non postal] - 0.03167

# Combined Postal and non postal using TPP for both times the amount of votes of each time from an area divided by total votes cast
# In effect this creates a ratio for each of the TPP's used and so produces a reasonably accurate estimate
# TPP Postal +  non postal
([TPP non postal]*[Votes non postal / absentee from SA1]+[TPP Postal / absentee  approx]*[Votes postal/ absentee])/([Votes non postal / absentee from SA1]+[Votes postal/ absentee])


## Swing against LNP incumbent calculation (more negative is good) based on local area

# Swing intermediate step non postal / absentee
SUM(IIF([PollingPlaceID]!=0,([votes from SA1]*[Swing]/100),0))

# Swing non postals / absentee
[Swing intermediate step non postal / absentee ]/[Votes non postal / absentee from SA1]

# Swing Postals based on local area rather than universal
[Swing non postal] - 0.0105
